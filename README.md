# blog-microservices

A simple blog app to aid in learning about the microservices' architecture using NodeJs and a simple React app. Pretty awesome.

### TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES LEARNT AND USED
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
  * How to set up(pain in the rearsðŸ’”), deploy and scale up.
* [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) - `Linux specific`
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  * How to package services
* [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/)
* ETC...
  * How to share data between services(different apps - microservices)
  * Asynchronous communication between services using events, enabling each service to be 100% self-sufficient.

###### I must say... What I have learnt so far about MicroServices is LITðŸ”¥ If you're an upcoming dev. This is a must add to your learning todo list!!!
